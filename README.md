## Usage

### LUNA Framework

The `luna` folder contains all the essential APIs for model abstraction and metrics calculation.

1. Navigate to the `luna` directory:

2. Use the API as needed. (Provide specific instructions or code examples here.)

### 🚀 **Example**

### **Initializing the MetricsAppEvalCollections Object**

To analyze your data, you first need to initialize the `MetricsAppEvalCollections` class. This class is responsible for collecting various metrics on your data based on abstract model representations:

```python
eval_obj = MetricsAppEvalCollections(
    state_abstract_args_obj,
    prob_args_obj,
    train_instances,
    val_instances,
    test_instances,
)
```

Where:

- `state_abstract_args_obj`: A namespace object containing arguments related to state abstraction (e.g., dataset name, block index, info type).
- `prob_args_obj`: A namespace object containing arguments related to probability calculations (e.g., dataset, PCA dimension, model type).
- `train_instances`, `val_instances`, `test_instances`: The data instances for training, validation, and testing.

### **Collecting Metrics**

Once the `MetricsAppEvalCollections` object is initialized, you can then collect various metrics. Here are some examples:

- Evaluating the model:

  ```python
  aucroc, _, _ = eval_obj.get_eval_result()
  ```

- Calculating preciseness:

  ```python
  preciseness = eval_obj.preciseness()
  ```

- Calculating entropy:

  ```python
  entropy = eval_obj.entropy()
  ```

... and many other metrics as shown in the `rq3` function.

## Evaluation of Summary Quality with GPT-3.5 Turbo-instruct

In our approach to assessing the quality of generated summaries for code snippets, we utilize the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo-instruct model. This advanced language model enables us to evaluate the relevance and accuracy of each generated summary compared to the ground truth.

### Prompt Structure

The model receives the following structured prompt for each instance:


### Evaluation Process

- **Input code**: The original code snippet provided for summarization.
- **Ground Truth Summary**: The human-written summary, serving as the benchmark for accuracy.
- **Generated Summary**: The summary produced by our code summarization model.
- **Model's Task**: To assess if the `Generated Summary` aligns well with the `Input code` and `Ground Truth Summary`. The model responds with `1` for a high-quality summary and `0` for a low-quality or irrelevant summary.

This automated and nuanced evaluation process, conducted by GPT-3.5 Turbo-instruct, offers a scalable and objective method to assess the quality of code summarizations. It ensures consistency in quality assessments across our dataset.

### Script for Quality Evaluation

The Python script that interfaces with the OpenAI API to perform this evaluation is located at `dataset/code_summarization/get_quality_by_gpt.py`. This script automates the process of sending prompts to the model and retrieving the quality scores for each summary.

## **API Overview**

### **Model Abstraction**

The process of abstracting the behavior and properties of a system into a simplified representation that retains only the essential characteristics of the original system. In the context of this framework, model abstraction is done based on state and probabilistic models.

#### **1. ProbabilisticModel (from probabilistic_abstraction_model.py)**
- **Purpose**: Provides a base for creating probabilistic models based on abstracted states.
  
- **Usage Examples**:
  ```python
  # Initialize the ProbabilisticModel
  prob_model = ProbabilisticModel(args)
  
  # Evaluate LLM performance on a dataset task
  prob_model.eval_llm_performance_on_dataset_task()
  
  # Compose scores with ground truths
  prob_model.compose_scores_with_groundtruths_pair()
  ```

#### **2. AbstractStateExtraction (from state_abstraction_utils.py)**
- **Purpose**: Extracts abstract states from provided data instances.
  
- **Usage Examples**:
  ```python
  # Initialize the AbstractStateExtraction
  state_extractor = AbstractStateExtraction(args)
  
  # Perform PCA on data
  state_extractor.perform_pca()
  
  # (Additional method usage examples would be included if available in the file)
  ```

### **Metrics Calculation**

Metrics provide a quantitative measure to evaluate the performance and characteristics of models. In this framework, metrics evaluate the quality and behavior of abstracted models.

#### **1. MetricsAppEvalCollections (from metrics_appeval_collection.py)**
- **Purpose**: Acts as a central utility for metric evaluations based on state abstractions.
  
- **Usage Examples**:
  ```python
  # Initialize the MetricsAppEvalCollections
  metrics_evaluator = MetricsAppEvalCollections(args_obj1, args_obj2, train_data, val_data, test_data)
  
  # Retrieve evaluation results
  aucroc, accuracy, f1_score, _, _, _ = metrics_evaluator.get_eval_result()
  
  # Calculate the preciseness of predictions
  preciseness_mean, preciseness_max = metrics_evaluator.preciseness()
  ```

### **📚 Metrics Categories**

#### **Model-wise Metrics**:
- **Succinctness (SUC)**
- **Stationary Distribution Entropy (SDE)**
- **Sink State (SS)**
- **Sensitivity (SEN)**
- **Coverage (COV)**
- **Perplexity (PERP)**

#### **Semantic Metrics**:
- **Preciseness (PRE)**
- **Entropy (ENT)**
- **Surprise Level (SL)**
- **N-gram Derivative Trend (NDT)**
- **Instance Value Trend (IVT)**
- **N-gram Value Trend (NVT)**

### **Usage Overview**

### Detailed Experiment Setup Example with LUNA Framework

To demonstrate the practical application of the LUNA framework, here is a detailed example based on the provided Python script `RQ23-all-settings.py`.

#### Step 1: Import Necessary Modules

Start by importing the required modules from the LUNA framework and other dependencies.

```python
from luna.metrics_appeval_collection import MetricsAppEvalCollections
import luna.data_loader as data_loader
from types import SimpleNamespace
import pandas as pd
from itertools import product
from collections import defaultdict
import os
from copy import deepcopy
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu
```

#### Step 2: Set Experiment Parameters

Configure the parameters for your experiment, including the language model, dataset, and various settings for abstraction and analysis.

```python
llm = "code_llama_7B_python"  # Language model
dataset = "humaneval"         # Dataset
info_type = "hidden_states"
extract_block_idx = "31"
abstraction_methods = ["Grid-based", "Cluster-based"]
partition_nums = [5, 10, 15]
abstraction_states = [200, 400, 600]
# ... other configurations
```

#### Step 3: Initialize Results Storage

Prepare a structure to store the results of your experiments.

```python
results = defaultdict(list)
```

Step 4: Running the Experiment with Command-line Argument
Use the command-line interface to run the experiment with a specified result save path. The script RQ23-all-settings.py accepts a --result_save_path argument to determine where to save the results. Here's how to run the experiment:

```bash
python RQ23-all-settings.py --result_save_path <path-to-save-results> --llm <target-llm>
```
This command will execute the script with the provided result save path. Ensure the path is correctly specified relative to the script's location. The script will internally handle the experiment setup, execution, and result storage based on the configurations set within the file.



```python
# Iterate through each abstraction method (Grid-based and Cluster-based)
for abstraction_method in abstraction_methods:
    # If Grid-based abstraction method is chosen
    if abstraction_method == "Grid-based":
        # Iterate through possible partition numbers for the grid-based method
        for partition_num in partition_nums:
            # Explore the impact of different PCA dimensions
            for pca_dim in grid_pca_dims:
                # Explore results for different probability models (DTMC and HMM)
                for model_type in probability_models:
                    # Explore different numbers of Grid history dependency
                    for grid_history_dependency_num in grid_history_dependency:
                        # If the model is Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
                        if model_type == "HMM":
                            # Iterate over different numbers of HMM components

        # (similar logic as above for cluster-based experiments)
        for abstraction_state, cluster_method in product(

                            write_result_to_csv(result, settings_str)

```

#### Step 5: Analyzing and Storing Results

Finally, analyze the collected results and store them for further evaluation.

```python
# Example of analyzing results
for metric, values in results.items():
    print(f"Results for {metric}: {values}")

# Storing results in a CSV file
results_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(results)
results_df.to_csv('experiment_results.csv', index=False)

```

This detailed example provides a clear guide on how to set up and run a comprehensive experiment using the LUNA framework, demonstrating its capability to handle complex configurations and analyses.
