"""Program Synthesis with Large Language Models
https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732

The benchmark consists of around 1,000 crowd-sourced Python programming problems, 
designed to be solvable by entry level programmers, covering programming fundamentals, 
standard library functionality, and so on. Each problem consists of a task description, 
code solution and 3 automated test cases. As described in the paper, a subset of the data
has been hand-verified by the authors.
